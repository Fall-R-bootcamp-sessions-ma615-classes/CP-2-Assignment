## CP2 Assignment Instructions

- Locate the `cp2_assignment.R` file under Computation in the Bootcamp Teams channel.
- Download the file and place it in an active repository (this can be a repo you already made, or a new repo if you feel like practicing)
- Open the file in RStudio

### Assignment Completion

- Within `cp2_assignment.R` you will find instructions about how to complete each exercise as well as empty variable names for you to assign your answers.
- Once you've completed the exercises, or just some of them, you can commit your changes to your repo like we've been practicing.
- Afterwards, locate **CP-2 Assignment** in Gradescope, submit the link for your repository to Gradescope.  Gradescope will score you accordingly.  Multiple submissions are encouraged and coding solutions to fit the specifics, pre-loaded, on Gradescope can be tricky.  Pay close attention to the instructions and your answers to make things easiest.
