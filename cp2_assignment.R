# Cp-2 Assignment

# Exercise 1

# Create the vector (2,0,2,3) and assign it to `aVector`

aVector <- 


# Exercise 2

# Create the vector (20,19,18,17,16,...,0). Call your vector `tweVector`

# Create the vector (2,1.9,1.8,1.7,1.6,...,0). Call your vector `twe.Vector`

# Create the vector (2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2), use the rep function. 
  #Call your vector `twoVector`

tweVector <- 
twe.Vector <- 
twoVector <- 


# Exercise 3

#Create a vector with the first 7 elements of pi. 
  #Call your vector `piVector`. 
  #After, using `rev` and `sort` create, 
  #`pieVector` with the `piVector` elements in decreasing order 
  #and `eipVector` with the elements in increasing order.

piVector <- 
eipVector <- 
pieVector <- 

# Exercise 4

# Construct a vector called `megaVector` that contains the following elements
  # the first and last element of `piVector` 
  # the elements of `pieVector` equal to `3` 
  # and the third and fourth elements of `eipVector`

megaVector <- 

# Exercise 5

# Use logical operators in your vector selections to construct 
  # the following from the `rivers` vector: 
  # `noMeanRivers` :Rivers less than 200 miles and rivers more than 600 miles 
  # `river301` :Rivers that are exactly 301 miles long 
  # `specRivers` :Rivers between 100 and 200 miles, 
  #        as well as rivers between 500 and 600 miles, 
  #        do not include rivers equal to 135

noMeanRivers <- 
river301 <- 
specRivers <- 

# Exercise 6

# Write a function that prints a message citing a 
  # relativity sized river given a positive integer 
  # representing miles, use the following rivers as breakpoints: 
  # Feather River: 73 miles 
  # Des Moines River: 525 miles 
  # Rio Grande River: 1896 miles

# Your function should return a string in the following format: 
# A river X miles long is shorter than/longer than/exactly as long the "most similar river from above".
 # ex:
# "A river 100 miles long is longer than the Feather River."


riverReport <- function(miles) {
